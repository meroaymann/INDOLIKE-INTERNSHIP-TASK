Task 3 - Climate Change Trends 


Climate Change Trends Analysis

Objective: 
Analyze historical global temperature records to identify long-term warming patterns and regional variations.

Dataset:
Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Data (Global + Country-level, 1750–2015).

Steps:
1. Filtered reliable data (post-1850).  
2. Computed annual averages and 10-year moving averages.  
3. Calculated temperature anomalies relative to the 1850-1900 baseline.  
4. Compared Egypt vs. global averages.

Findings
- Global average temperature rose by ~1.5 °C since pre-industrial times.  
- The warming trend accelerated sharply after 1950.  
- Egypt follows a similar pattern of steady temperature increase.
