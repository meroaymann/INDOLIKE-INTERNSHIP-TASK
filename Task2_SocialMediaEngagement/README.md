Task 2 - Social Media Engagement Analysis 

This project analyzes a Twitter Entity Sentiment dataset (~75K tweets) to understand which factors contribute to higher user engagement.
Although explicit engagement metrics (likes/retweets) are not provided, textual and structural features are analyzed as engagement proxies (e.g., emotion, length, hashtags, mentions, and punctuation).

- Steps:-
Combined training & validation datasets (75,682 tweets).

Cleaned and normalized sentiment labels.

Engineered engagement-related features (text length, mentions, hashtags, emojis, URLs, exclamation marks, uppercase ratio).

Visualized sentiment distribution, top platforms, and sentiment composition per platform.

Quantified correlations between features and positive sentiment.

- Insights:-

Tweets with shorter text and more exclamation marks tend to be more positive (emotional → engaging).

Tweets with mentions or URLs lean negative (complaints or factual posts).

Gaming platforms like League of Legends and Apex Legends receive the highest discussion volume and positive engagement share.

Overall, expressive tone (enthusiasm) correlates with higher positivity — a common marker of online engagement.
